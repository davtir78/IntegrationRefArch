Integration Reference Architecture

I have worked as an architect across a wide range of industries including Telecommunications, Retail, Logistics, Financial Services and Scientific Organisations in Australia and Europe.  With the pandemic and five lockdowns in Melbourne giving me some spare time at home I thought I would share some of my knowledge acquired over the last twenty years working in the integration domain.

What is a reference architecture?
According to Wikipedia “a reference architecture in the field of software architecture or enterprise architecture provides a template solution for an architecture for a particular domain. It also provides a common vocabulary with which to discuss implementations, often with the aim to stress commonality.”  Adopting a reference architecture within an organization accelerates delivery through the re-use of an effective solution and provides a basis for governance to ensure the consistency and applicability of technology use within an organization.
Reference architecture can be an asset to an organisation as they provide the following benefits:
•	Providing common language for stakeholders
•	Providing consistency of implementation of technology solutions
•	Encouraging adherence to common standards, specifications, and patterns

Component Model
The below component model provides a viewpoint of the components that make up the reference architecture.  The below model contains a fully featured integration platform however many organisations may not require every component.  It needs to be tailor for each organisation, consider colour coding the component model to show which components are available in an organisation, which are on the roadmap for the future and those which are not being actively considered.
